                <p>
                    The Historic Metahumans is a research project that aims to preserve the essence of historical figures through digital recreation. This recreation process includes facial reconstruction, large language models, text-to-speech, and gesture generation. This project was accepted by the American Society of Overseas Research (ASOR) Annual Meeting 2024 as a conference poster.<br> <br>
                    I joined the Historic Metahumans project in January 2024 and became a Research Team Lead in charge of 12 other students. I focused on analyzing different machine learning models for facial reconstruction to use for our metahuman pipeline and the creation of the metahuman models in Unreal Engine. Additionally, I also handled training of our LLM and text-to-speech (TTS) models. We were able to create a complete metahuman pipeline that allows not only for the creation of new metahuman models, but also lets users interact with the historical figures through communication with our LLM to TTS pipeline. <br><br>
