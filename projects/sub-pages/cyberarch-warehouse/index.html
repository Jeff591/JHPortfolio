                <p>
                    The Cyber Archeology Warehouse is an Unreal Engine application designed to give academics and researchers ways to study artifact models and archeological sites in VR classrooms while preserving them in digital form where they can accessed remotely.<br> <br>
                    I joined the Cyber Archeology Warehouse project in April 2023 as an intern and took charge of importing models into Unreal in real time from online repositories. Over the summer of 2023, I spent more time developing the Web UI using React.js to interface with online repositories such as Sketchfab and SeaweedFS where we can view currently stored models, edit model metadata, and upload new models. This involved either interfacing with premade APIs or creating a REST API using Express.js. Once models are imported into the VR environment, users will be able to scale the artifacts, see their metadata, and transport to real world locations using Cesium. <br><br>
