                <p>
                    The Climate Games is a game platform that allows users to collaboratively create their own virtual worlds, quests, and characters to advocate for issues such as climate change. This project was accepted as a conference poster at the American Society of Oriental Research (ASOR) Annual Meeting 2024.<br> <br>
                    I joined The Climate Games project in June 2024 and was tasked with creating a character customization system that allows users to change the clothes, hair, body, and voice of metahumans within the game. This system is an integration of the Historic Metahumans project and builds upon it by adding metahumans as non-player characters that dictate quests and can be interacted with via a chat box or voice chat. This system also includes a method of storing characters to player profiles via CouchDB.<br><br>
